<p>Hi, I'm Konstantine, a student who decided to take control of my health after struggling with balancing school, stress, and living a healthy lifestyle. </p>

<p>Like many, I found it hard to figure out where to start, with so much conflicting advice online. But after realizing how important it was to feel good both mentally and physically, I decided to make some changes.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through trial and error, I found simple, sustainable habits that made a real difference. Now, I’ve created FitGuide to help others who are in the same position I was. Whether you're juggling school, work, or just life in general, my goal is to share practical tips and resources to help you live a healthier, happier life.</p>
